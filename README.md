# DevConfig

Setup for Janella's dev environment and command line.

I use Powershell on Windows Terminal and I don't really have a fancy setup. 

## Helper methods in this repo

These helper methods assume that your remote repository is named `origin` and your remote trunk branch is named `master`.

* `gnew [name]` - checkout latest `master` and create a new local branch with a given name from `master`.
* `gpr` - push the current branch and open a browser window to start a PR.
* `gpull` - fetch and rebase your current branch on `master`.
* `gpush` - push your current branch to a remote branch of the same name.
* `gsweep` - delete all local branches that have been merged with master.
* `gsync` - fetch latest `master`.
* `gpatch [number of commits back]` - Add local current changes to a commit `X` commits behind. `gpatch-continue` when ready to complete the update.
    * You'll need to edit the rebase file after `gpatch`. (the default editor is `vim` - `del` to delete, `i` to switch to insert mode, `esc` to get to commands, and `:wq` to save and exit).
    * Adapted from _[How to add a changed file to an older not-last commit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2719579/how-to-add-a-changed-file-to-an-older-not-last-commit-in-git)_.

## Fresh machine setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow steps 1 and 3 in [Scott Hanselman's blog Windows Terminal blog](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/how-to-make-a-pretty-prompt-in-windows-terminal-with-powerline-nerd-fonts-cascadia-code-wsl-and-ohmyposh).
3. Edit `settings.json` and `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` and make sure the various directory paths are in the right place (eg `C:/` or `D:/`).
    * I have two machines set up slightly differently... ðŸ™ƒ
4. Run `./CopyToSettings.ps1` to copy all of the styles etc. 
    * Using the argument `-ReplaceProfile` will replace the current Powershell profile with the one in this repo.
    * If you're not me and have stuff in your `Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1` you want to keep, then you might not want to do this. ðŸ˜‡ Feel free to check your local by running `notepad $PROFILE`.

## Updating this repository
If I make any local edits/updates to my setup, I don't want to faff around copying to this repo, so I wrote a script for it.

1. Run `./CopyToSettings.ps1` to copy all of the bits in this repo.
    * Using the argument `-ReplaceProfile` will also copy over the Powershell profile, as above.
2. Fix anything you need to before committing and updating.

# Handy commands because I always forget them
> `$PROFILE` - Get the location of your Powershell Profile.
